A very basic snapshot fuzzer using KVM to test ideas and learn.

**Very WIP!**

Currently able to run a full fuzz loop with coverage and find the crash in [example01](https://github.com/awslabs/snapchange/tree/main/examples/01_getpid) from Snapchange.
I'm also re-using the QEMU patches for snapshotting from Snapchange.
